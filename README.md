# meanjs-calendar

An Angular.js UI Calendar module for Mean.js

This is mainly intended as an additional demo module for learners of Mean.js, in particular members of CSCI-240 at the University of Puget Sound. It is a simple integration of the [Angular UI Calendar](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-calendar/) as a Mean.js CRUD module. I've tried to keep it as stripped down as possible to make it easy to understand, and I will be adding extensive explanatory comments. 

## Installation

The simplest way to install the module is to download the .zip file, unzip the directory, and place it in your `modules` directory. You will also need to make sure that the following dependencies are installed:

* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/)
* [FullCalendar.io](http://fullcalendar.io/download/)
* [Angular UI Calendar](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-calendar)

Install these with Bower using `bower install --save` to ensure they get added to your `bower.json` file.

As with other dependencies we've seen in Mean.js, you should *not* place the script tags in the HTML by hand. This is handled automatically if your dependency paths are correctly added to `/config/assets/default.js`. Look at that file closely to understand how dependencies are added there.
